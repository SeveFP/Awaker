### Awaker

Awaker is a [Riddim](http://code.matthewwild.co.uk/riddim) plugin to turn on computers on a LAN via [Wake-on-LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN)

The bot will listen to any messages containing the name associated to a MAC address in the plugin's file and try to wake it up.

The bot with the Awaker plugin must be inside the LAN where the computers to wake up are, but not the XMPP contact. That means one can wake up a computer using Awaker from any other network.
